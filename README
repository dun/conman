ConMan is a serial console management program designed to support a large
number of console devices and simultaneous users.  It currently supports
local serial devices and remote terminal servers (via the telnet protocol).
Its features include:

  - mapping symbolic names to console devices
  - logging all output from a console device to file
  - supporting monitor (R/O), interactive (R/W), and
    broadcast (W/O) modes of console access
  - allowing clients to join or steal console "write" privileges
  - executing Expect scripts across multiple consoles in parallel
