##
# The daemon's COREDUMP keyword specifies whether the daemon should generate a
#   core dump file.  This file will be created in the current working directory
#   (or '/' when running in the background) unless you also set COREDUMPDIR.
#   The default is OFF.
##
# server coredump=(on|off)
##

##
# The daemon's COREDUMPDIR keyword specifies the directory where the daemon
#   tries to write core dump files.  The default is empty, meaning the current
#   working directory (or '/' when running in the background) will be used.
##
# server coredumpdir="<dir>"
##

##
# The daemon's EXECPATH keyword specifies a colon-separated list of directories
#   in which to search for external process-based console executables that are
#   not defined by an absolute or relative pathname.  The default is empty.
##
# server execpath="<dir1:dir2:dir3...>"
##

##
# The daemon's KEEPALIVE keyword specifies whether the daemon will use
#   TCP keep-alives for detecting dead connections.  The default is ON.
##
# server keepalive=(on|off)
##

##
# The daemon's LOGDIR keyword specifies a directory prefix for log files that
#   are not defined via an absolute pathname.  This affects the SERVER LOGFILE,
#   GLOBAL LOG, and CONSOLE LOG directives.
##
# server logdir="<dir>"
##

##
# The daemon's LOGFILE keyword specifies the file to which log messages are
#   appended if the daemon is not running in the foreground.  This string
#   undergoes conversion specifier expansion each time the file is opened.
#   If an absolute pathname is not given, the file's location is relative to
#   either LOGDIR (if defined) or the current working directory.  Intermediate
#   directories will be created as needed.
# The filename may optionally be followed by a comma and a minimum priority
#   at which messages will be logged.  Refer to the syslog.conf(5) man page
#   for a list of priorities.  The default priority is 'info'.
# If this keyword is used in conjunction with the SYSLOG keyword,
#   messages will be sent to both locations.
##
# server logfile="<file>[,<priority>]"
##

##
# The daemon's LOOPBACK keyword specifies whether the daemon will bind its
#   socket to the loopback address, thereby only accepting local client
#   connections directed to that address (127.0.0.1).  The default is ON.
##
# server loopback=(on|off)
##

##
# The daemon's NOFILE keyword specifies the maximum number of open files for
#   the daemon.  If set to 0, use the current (soft) limit.  If set to -1,
#   use the the maximum (hard) limit.  The default is 0.
##
# server nofile=<int>
##

##
# The daemon's PIDFILE keyword specifies the file to which the daemon's PID is
#   written.  Intermediate directories will be created as needed.  The use of
#   a pidfile is recommended if you want to use the daemon's '-k' or '-r'
#   options.
##
# server pidfile="<file>"
##

##
# The daemon's PORT keyword specifies the port on which the daemon will
#   listen for client connections.
##
# server port=<int>
##

##
# The daemon's RESETCMD keyword specifies a command string to be invoked by
#   a subshell upon receipt of the client's "reset" escape.  Multiple commands
#   within a string may be separated with semicolons.  This string undergoes
#   conversion specifier expansion and will be invoked multiple times if the
#   client is connected to multiple consoles.
##
# server resetcmd="<str>"
##

##
# The daemon's SYSLOG keyword specifies that log messages are to be sent
#   to the system logger (syslogd) at the given facility.  Refer to the
#   syslog.conf(5) man page for a list of facilities.
# If this keyword is used in conjunction with the LOGFILE keyword,
#   messages will be sent to both locations.
##
# server syslog="<facility>"
##

##
# The daemon's TCPWRAPPERS keyword specifies whether the daemon will
#   use Wietse Venema's TCP-Wrappers when accepting client connections.
#   Support for this feature must be enabled at compile-time
#   (via configure's "--with-tcp-wrappers" option).  Refer to the
#   hosts_access(5) and hosts_options(5) man pages for more details.
#   The default is OFF.
##
# server tcpwrappers=(on|off)
##

##
# The daemon's TIMESTAMP keyword specifies the interval between timestamps
#   written to all console log files.  The interval is an integer that may
#   be followed by a single-char modifier; 'm' for minutes (the default),
#   'h' for hours, or 'd' for days.  The default is 0 (ie, no timestamps).
##
# server timestamp=<int>(m|h|d)
##

##
# The global LOG keyword specifies the default log file to use for each
#   CONSOLE directive.  This string undergoes conversion specifier expansion
#   each time the file is opened; it must contain either '%N' or '%D'.  If an
#   absolute pathname is not given, the file's location is relative to either
#   LOGDIR (if defined) or the current working directory.  Intermediate
#   directories will be created as needed.
##
# global log="<file>"
##

##
#  The global LOGOPTS keyword specifies options for console log files.
#    These options can be overridden on an per-console basis by specifying
#    the CONSOLE LOGOPTS keyword.  Note that options affecting the output
#    of the console's logfile also affect the output of the console's
#    log-replay escape.
#  The valid logopts include the following:
#    - "lock" or "nolock" - locked logs are protected with a write lock.
#    - "sanitize" or "nosanitize" - sanitized logs convert non-printable
#      characters into 7-bit printable characters.
#    - "timestamp" or "notimestamp" - timestamped logs prepend each line
#      of console output with a timestamp in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format.
#      This timestamp is generated when the first character following the
#      line break is output.
#  The default is "lock,nosanitize,notimestamp".
##
# global logopts="lock,nosanitize,notimestamp"
##

##
# The global SEROPTS keyword specifies options for local serial devices;
#    These options can be overridden on an per-console basis by specifying
#    the CONSOLE SEROPTS keyword.
# The default is "9600,8n1" for 9600 bps, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.
##
# global seropts="9600,8n1"
##

##
#  The global IPMIOPTS keyword specifies global options for IPMI
#    Serial-Over-LAN devices.  These options can be overridden on a per-console
#    basis by specifying the CONSOLE IPMIOPTS keyword.  This directive is only
#    available if configured using the "--with-freeipmi" option.
#  The IPMIOPTS string is parsed into comma-delimited substrings where each
#    substring is of the form "X:VALUE".  "X" is a single-character
#    case-insensitive key specifying the option type, and "VALUE" is its
#    corresponding value.  The IPMI default will be used if either "VALUE" is
#    omitted from the substring ("X:") or the substring is omitted altogether.
#    Note that since the IPMIOPTS string is delimited by commas, substring
#    values cannot contain commas.
#  The valid IPMIOPTS substrings include the following (in any order):
#    - U:<username> - a string of at most 16 bytes for the username.
#    - P:<password> - a string of at most 20 bytes for the password.
#    - K:<K_g> - a string of at most 20 bytes for the K_g key.
#    - C:<cipher_suite> - an integer for the IPMI cipher suite ID.
#    - L:<privilege_level> - the string "user", "op", or "admin".
#    - W:<workaround_flag> - a string or integer for an IPMI workaround.
#      The following strings are recognized: "authcap", "intel20",
#      "supermicro20", "sun20", "opensesspriv", "integritycheckvalue",
#      "solpayloadsize", "solport", and "solstatus".  This substring may be
#      repeated in order to specify multiple workarounds.
#  Both the <password> and <K_g> values can be specified in either ASCII or
#    hexadecimal; in the latter case, the string should begin with "0x" and
#    contain at most 40 hexadecimal digits.  A <K_g> key entered in hexadecimal
#    may contain embedded null characters, but any characters following the
#    first null character in the <password> key will be ignored.
##
# global ipmiopts="U:<str>,P:<str>,K:<str>,C:<int>,L:<str>,W:<flag>"
##

##
# The CONSOLE directive defines a console being managed by the daemon.
# The NAME keyword specifies the name used by clients to refer to the console.
# The DEV keyword specifies the type and location of the device.
#   - A local serial port connection is defined by the pathname of the
#     character device file.
#   - A remote terminal server connection using the telnet protocol is defined
#     by the "<host>:<port>" format (where <host> is the remote hostname or
#     IPv4 address, and <port> is the remote port number).
#   - An external process-based connection is defined by the "<path> <args>"
#     format (where <path> is the pathname to an executable file/script, and
#     any additional <args> are space-delimited).
#   - A local Unix domain socket connection is defined by the "unix:<path>"
#     format (where "unix:" is the literal character string prefix and <path>
#     is the pathname of the local socket).
#   - An IPMI Serial-Over-LAN connection is defined by the "ipmi:<host>" format
#     (where "ipmi:" is the literal string and <host> is a hostname or IPv4
#     address).
#   The '%N' character sequence will be replaced by the console name.
# The optional LOG keyword specifies the file where console output is logged.
#   This string undergoes conversion specifier expansion each time the file is
#   opened.  If an absolute pathname is not given, the file's location is
#   relative to either LOGDIR (if defined) or the current working directory.
#   Intermediate directories will be created as needed.  An empty log string
#   (ie, log="") disables logging, overriding the GLOBAL LOG name.
# The optional LOGOPTS, SEROPTS, and IPMIOPTS keywords override the global
#   settings.
