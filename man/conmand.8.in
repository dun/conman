.TH CONMAND 8 "@DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "ConMan: The Console Manager"

.SH NAME
conmand \- ConMan daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B conmand
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBconmand\fR is the daemon responsible for managing consoles defined by its
configuration file as well as listening for connections from clients.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c \fIfile\fR
Specify a configuration file, overriding the default location [@CONMAN_CONF@].
.TP
.B \-F
Run the daemon in the foreground.
.TP
.B \-h
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.B \-k
Send a SIGTERM to the \fBconmand\fR process associated with the specified
configuration, thereby killing the daemon.  Returns 0 if the daemon was
successfully signaled; otherwise, returns 1.
.TP
.B \-L
Display license information.
.TP
.B \-p \fIport\fR
Specify the port on which \fBconmand\fR will listen for clients, overriding
both the default port [@CONMAN_PORT@] and the port specified in the
configuration file.
.TP
.B \-P \fIfile\fR
Specify the PID file for storing the daemon's PID, overriding the "\fBserver
pidfile\fR" directive in the configuration file.
.TP
.B \-q
Displays the PID of the \fBconmand\fR process associated with the specified
configuration if it appears active.  Returns 0 if the configuration appears
active; otherwise, returns 1.
.TP
.B \-r
Send a SIGHUP to the \fBconmand\fR process associated with the specified
configuration, thereby re-opening both that daemon's log file and individual
console log files.  Returns 0 if the daemon was successfully signaled;
otherwise, returns 1.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-V
Display version information.
.TP
.B \-z
Truncate both the daemon's log file and individual console log files
at start-up.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP 12
.B SIGHUP
Close and re-open both the daemon's log file and the individual console
log files.  Conversion specifiers within filenames will be re-evaluated.
This is useful for \fBlogrotate\fR configurations.
.TP
.B SIGTERM
Terminate the daemon.

.SH SECURITY
Connections to the server are not authenticated, and communications between
client and server are not encrypted.  Until this is addressed in a future
release, the recommendation is to bind the server's listen socket to the
loopback address (by specifying "\fBserver loopback=on\fR" in conman.conf)
and restrict access to the server host.

.SH NOTES
Log messages are sent to standard-error until after the configuration file
has been read, at which time future messages are discarded unless either
the \fBlogfile\fR or \fBsyslog\fR keyword has been specified (see
\fBconman.conf(5)\fR).
.PP
If the configuration file is modified while the daemon is running and a
\fBpidfile\fR was not originally specified, the '\fB\-k\fR' and '\fB\-r\fR'
options may be unable to identify the daemon process; consequently, the
appropriate signal may need to be sent to the daemon manually.
.PP
The number of consoles that can be simultaneously managed is limited by the
maximum number of file descriptors a process can have open.  The daemon sets
its "nofile" soft limit to the maximum/hard limit.  If you are encountering
"too many open files" errors, you may need to increase the "nofile" hard limit.
