	  to socket obj name.

	* : Updated src file banner.

	* client-tty.c: Changed msg to reflect that a broadcast to one console
	  is treated like a normal interactive connection to a single console.

	* server-obj.c, client-conf.c, server-conf.c: Added check to ensure
	  list exists before calling list_destroy().

	* server-sock.c: Initial support for broadcast connect.  Refactored
	  process_client() and create_req().  Ensured req->host is never NULL.

	* server.h: Tweaked comments.

2001-05-23  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* client-conf.c, client-tty.c, conman.h: Modified client to display
	  msg when console opened/closed/suspended/resumed/terminated by peer.

2001-05-22  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* INSTALL: New (from autoconf-2.50).

	* auxdir/install-sh, auxdir/config.guess, auxdir/config.sub,
	  config.h.in, configure: Updated to autoconf-2.50.

	* conman.h: Changed MAX_BUF_SIZE from 4096 to 8192.

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.in, util.c: Added check for
	  localtime_r().

	* list.c, list.h: Added list_peek().

2001-05-21  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* client.h: Reformatted client_conf_t struct.

	* client-tty.c, client.h: Added option to suspend client.

	* client-sock.c, client.c, client.h, conman.h, server-sock.c:
	  Changed client/server protocol to return names of selected consoles
	  in the "OK" response header.

2001-05-18  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* server-sock.c: Fixed bug in query_consoles() regex-matching so
	  patterns are now anchored.

	* client-conf.c: Removed 'E' cmd-line option to disable esc char.

	* : Released 0.0.3.

	* server-conf.c, server-obj.c, server.c, server.h: Revamped obj
	  routines.  Changed obj behavior so objs are always open to their fd.
	  Checked to ensure console is a tty device.  Added optimization to
	  read_from_obj() that primes objs for write_to_obj().  Added return
	  value to write_to_obj() to indicate whether obj is at EOF with buffer
	  flushed and ready for destruction by mux_io() loop.

	* server-sock.c: Added checks to validate_req().  Added support for
	  CONNECT cmd (w/o BROADCAST).  Added support for MONITOR cmd.

	* client-conf.c, client-sock.c, client-tty.c: Twiddled format of
	  output messages.

	* util.c, util.h: Added create_time_delta_string().

2001-05-16  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* : Released 0.0.2.

	* client-tty.c: Fixed bug that allowed characters to be transmitted
	  to server during MONITOR cmd (where server discarded them anyways).

2001-05-15  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* client-sock.c: Fixed bug in send_req() that sent OPTION and
	  BROADCAST tokens as strings by mistakenly enclosing them in quotes.

	* server.c: Fixed bug in comment.

	* server.c, server.h, server-sock.c: Fixed bug caused by accept()
	  being called outside of mux_io()'s select() loop.

2001-05-14  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* client.h, client-conf.c, client-sock.c, client-tty.c: Added msg
	  indicating if connection was terminated by peer.  Changed client
	  behavior to initiate active close of connection so it would enter
	  TIME_WAIT instead of server (unless connection terminated by peer).

	* server-sock.c: Fixed bug where client socket connection was not
	  closed on error (thereby causing client to hang in
	  display_data:read).

	* : Released 0.0.1.

	* client-conf.c, client-tty.c, server-conf.c, server-obj.c,
	  server-sock.c, server.c, server.h: Support for QUERY and CONNECT.

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.in, list.h, list.c:
	  Added USE_THREAD_SAFE_LIST def.

	* Makefile.in: Twiddled 'clean' target.

	* lex.c, lex.h: Twiddled dox.

2001-05-11  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* client-conf.c, client-sock.c, client-tty.c, client.h, conman.h,
	  server-conf.c, server-obj.c, server-sock.c, server.c, server.h:
	  Initial implementation of CONNECT cmd.

	* util.c: Twiddled comments.

	* errors.c: Added <stdlib.h> include for exit().

	* errors.h: Fixed bug in LDPRINTF macro.

	* lex.c: Added assertion & comments to lex_encode() & lex_decode().
	  Added <string.h> include for memcpy().

2001-05-09  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>

	* client.h, conman.h, errors.c, server-obj.c, server-sock.c, server.c,
	  server.h, util.c, client-conf.c, client-sock.c, client-tty.c,
	  client.c: Initial implementation of QUERY cmd.

	* lex.c, lex.h: Added lex_encode() & lex_decode().

	* list.c: Replaced iterator chain while-loops with for-loops.

2001-05-07  Chris Dunlap  <cdunlap@llnl.gov>
